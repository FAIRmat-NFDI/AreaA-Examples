# Part 2.1: Using Built-In ELNs
In NOMAD, you can structure and save your experimental data using Built-In ELN schemas that resemble ELNs (Electronic Lab Notebooks).

This tutorial guides you through some of these schemas using an example from sintering. We will learn how to use NOMAD's ExperimentELN, SampleELN, ProcessELN, and MeasurementELN schemas to digitize a fictional experimental workflow. 

## Pre-requisites
We will work on the [NOMAD example oasis](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/oasis/gui/search/entries). Make sure you have your NOMAD account ready to work on the example oasis.

## Create an Upload
The first step for uploading data to NOMAD is creating an "Upload", which will
contains your raw files along with the processed entries generated by NOMAD. Read more about uploads [here](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/oasis/docs/reference/glossary.html#upload).

Follow these steps to create your upload.

## Add the Experiment and steps involved
After you create an upload, we will create an entry using ExperimentELN. This will act as a container for all the steps involved. For our example, these steps are sintering and XRD measurement.

A graphical summary of our experiment is available in the `Overview > Workflow` section.

# Part 2.2: Customization of the ELNs
The built-in ELNs are general schemas. They can be used for myriad types of processes and measurements. Owing to their simplicity, however, they can be limiting when specific schema requirements are available.

Luckily, NOMAD provides two ways of adding technique-specific behavior to the ELNs.

- YAML schemas - config file containing schemas which added to the upload folder
- Plugins - Python package added as an extension to NOMAD

Using our sintering example, we will show how to specialize the process ELN with a YAML schema. We also show how to use a pre-implemented plugin to create an XRD specific measurement ELN.
