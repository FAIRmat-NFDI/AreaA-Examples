    FAIRmat Tutorial 13, presented by FAIRmat Area A Synthesis, introduces NOMAD and NOMAD Oasis as essential tools for research data management (RDM). This tutorial will specifically demonstrate how to utilize these tools for managing experimental materials science data, with a particular focus on synthesis data. NOMAD addresses critical challenges such as fragmented information across various data silos, the need for cohesive integration of diverse informational environments, and the critical demand for enhanced metadata quality. These capabilities are key to ensuring that data meets the FAIR principles—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—thereby promoting more effective research and innovation in materials science.
    
    Participants will learn about NOMAD's versatile data model, which ensures data interoperability, and its various types and levels of schemas, including custom yaml schemas, community standards, plugins, and BaseSections. The tutorial will also cover the integration of NOMAD with Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) to enhance data documentation and management.

    A practical session will guide users through a typical synthesis data example, demonstrating how to start from NOMAD's built-in ELNs, develop a data schema, convert it into a NOMAD plugin for automated data processing, and deploy the schema on a local NOMAD Oasis. This hands-on approach will provide invaluable insights into customizing NOMAD to fit specific experimental workflows.

    The session is designed to serve various user groups, including standard users, data stewards & data scientists, and system administrators, ensuring that each participant gains a comprehensive understanding of the tool's capabilities and applications in their respective roles. Join us to explore how NOMAD can transform your approach to data management in experimental synthesis, leading to more efficient and coherent research outputs - FAIR principles in practice.

## stuff (delete later)
the common obstacles faced in the field of synthesis regarding research data management (RDM). These challenges include 
    * dealing with dispersed information across independent data silos, 
    * integrating varied informational environments, 
    * and the limited availability of comprehensive metadata. 

FAIRmat Tutorial 13, presented by Area A Synthesis, is dedicated to addressing the prevalent challenges in the synthesis sector—specifically, the issues arising from fragmented information across autonomous data silos, the difficulties in merging independently developed information spaces, and the scarcity of rich metadata. This tutorial will introduce participants to the NOMAD and NOMAD Oasis, a robust tool designed to manage and process experimental research data in accordance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.
