# Part 3: Developing a NOMAD Plugin
In this part of the tutorial you will learn how to create and develop a NOMAD plugin.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account, can be created for free on [github.com](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
- Basic understanding of Python
- Basic understanding of NOMAD metainfo, see for example [tutorial 8](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/events/fairmat-tutorial-8/tutorial-8-materials)

## 1. Create a Git(Hub) repository for the plugin
We recommend to use git to version control your NOMAD plugin.
There is a GitHub template repository that can be used for this at [github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-plugin-template](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-plugin-template).

To use the template you should choose the "Create an new repository" option after pressing
the green "Use this template" button in the upper right corner.
Please note that you have to be logged into to GitHub to see this option.
