# Part 7: Search your ELN entries

In this tutorial we show you how to serach for the entries that you generate by using your NOMAD ELN.

## Prerequisites

If you did the previous parts, you will be able to continue to search your entries in the NOMAD installation you used. For this tutorial we used the [NOMAD (beta) page](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/gui/search/entries). Do not forget to login to see the entries in your unpublished uploads!

## Further Documentation
In this part, we will look at how we can search for our ELN entries in NOMAD.
Before starting, it is worth checking two tutorial videos that we did in the past related to general search in NOMAD:
- 🔍Exploring your data with NOMAD: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38S2U-TIvxE
- 🤖Using NOMAD's API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1frBCrxC0g

In these tutorials, Markus Scheidgen (the head developer of NOMAD) explains you how to use the search functionality and how you can also leverage it with the API.

Since these tutorials were made, we have implemented new functionalities and changed the branding of the webpage. But don't worry, the fundamentals explained in those videos are still valid and without a doubt, very helpful material. I highly recommend you to watch them.

## Hands-on and excersise 
Now it is time to search for the data that you generated by populating your ELN schemas. 
1. 🔍Go to the [EXPLORE/ELN page](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/gui/search/eln).
2. Search your entries by finding yourself as an author. For this you can just type your name in the main search bar, or in the left filter panel under the **Author / Origin / Dataset** section.

*TIP: if you click in the `+` button next to authors, you will bring the widget to the central dashboard and will be able to see the authors there.* 
3. Go to the **User Defined Quantities** section in the left filter panel. 
Keep in mind that you can look for your custom defined quantities here as long as they are single values (such as strings or scalars). This feature is new and we have plans to improve it further in the future.

	- Search for your quantity path
	- Use the different operator fuction **OP** accoridng to what you want to search (`>`, `<`, `=`).
	- You can change the unit in numerical values by typing, e. g., from `m` to `nm`.
	- Combine multiple search by adding then together with the **ADD** button.
	- Click on **Update Search** to update the search.
4. Additional quantities related to the ELN can be found in the **Electronic Lab Notebook** section, for exmaple the `Lab ID`. This will get populated if you are using the ELN `base_sections` in your schemas.
