# Part 3: NOMAD usage

In this part of the tutorial we will guide you through your first steps in NOMAD.

## Prerequisites

- A browser and access to a nomad instance :)
- Local nomad may be used but to have the same features available as in the tutorial it's best to use the nomad beta server ([nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/gui/about/information)).

## Flow

1. Show how to create an account and how to login. Let people follow along
2. Walk through the different tabs and highlight:
   - The entries section where users can search for any data
   - The nomad api to interact programmatically
   - The north tools to work on the server
   - Point to general documentation about nomad (especially on how to write elns)
3. Creating an eln entry in three different ways
   1. Upload eln file (with and without json data file)
   2. Use a predifined eln
   3. Edit an existing eln entry
4. Browse through the created entry and explain each part
   - Especially overview and data
   - Explain referenced by and flags on top (`code specific`, `all defined`, `definitions`)
5. Back to the overview page
   - Buttons for refreshing, reprocessing - shortly explain the processing
   - Show the collaborateurs part and add Andrea, Hampus and Pepe

## What you should have at the end of this part

- A NOMAD account
- You are logged in with your account
- A basic understanding where to find all necessar
- A basic understanding of how to create an eln based upload
