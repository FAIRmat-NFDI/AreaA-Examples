# Part 3: NOMAD usage

In this part of the tutorial we will guide you through your first steps in NOMAD.

## Prerequisites

- A browser and access to a nomad instance :)
- Local nomad may be used but to have the same features available as in the tutorial it's best to use the nomad beta server ([nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/gui/about/information)).

## Flow

Here is a [scribe](https://scribehow.com/shared/Login_and_create_an_ELN_entry_in_NOMAD__pLmbHrFeTD-iauxqfjxfZg

## What you should have at the end of this part

- A NOMAD account
- You are logged in with your account
- A basic understanding where to find all necessary features in NOMAD
- A basic understanding of how to create an eln based upload
