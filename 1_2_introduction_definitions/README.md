# Content and structure of part 1: Introduction and Definitions

This part is based on our Area A FAIRmat user meeting talk.

## Structure:
1. Motivation: RDM in synthesis (or more general?)
   * present situation 
   * towards data-driven methods and automatization
   * why good RDM?
   * ELN: concept 
2. FAIRmat and Area A, NOMAD
   * RDM by FAIRmat and Area A: short overview on FAIRmat and our area
   * NOMAD as our tool we develop for FAIR RDM, only short since we go in detail later:
     * central NOMAD (and where it comes from), NOMAD Oasis --> local RDM tool, NOMAD ELN functionality --> directly produce FAIR and structured data (in contrast to other ELN approaches/philosophies), concept of data workflow in NOMAD (diagram), structured-data-first approach
   * FAIRmat approach
   * in this tutorial: how to get to FAIR and structured data with NOMAD --> schema 
     * 1. 
3. Definitions: Structured data, FAIR data, schema etc
   * data workflow: raw data, ELN, data analysis --> data model (schema) --> implementation in NOMAD
   * schema, template concepts
   
   * Area A is developing a data model which is applied here in the examples, still work in progress, result of a discussion from scientiest of different areas, goal of data model: being generic to serve any experimentalist, harmonizes with data models from other Area
